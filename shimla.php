    Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh and a popular hill-station among Indian families and honeymooners. Situated at the height of 2200m, Shimla was the summer capital of British India.

The city has an airport as well; however, there aren't many daily flights from here. The railway station connects Shimla with the plans and is famous for the Kalka-Shimla train route; a UNESCO listed World Heritage site.The weather is pleasant for most of the months with tourists flocking especially during the summer months. The winters are cold with some days of snow from mid-December till February end.Shimla is often covered along with nearby towns of Kufri, a hill-station almost always covered by snow and Chail, famous for a huge palace and the highest cricket ground in the world.
